# whatsapp-to-slack

### Introduction
whatsapp-to-slack is a tool that converts your exported WhatsApp chat (must be exported from the mobile app) to a CSV file that can be imported into Slack.

Note: The conversion is done locally. No data is shared with the internet!

### Setup
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your computer. It's recommended to create a virtual Python environment to install the dependencies.

Once you have Python installed, it is a good practice to create a virtual python environment to install the dependencies.

To create a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
```

Once youâ€™ve created the virtual environment, you need to activate it. On Windows, run:

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

On Unix or MacOS, run:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Now, install the dependencies

```
pip install pandas colorama
```

Everything should work correctly now.

### Help

For an overview of available arguments, use:

```
python src/main.py -h
```

This will display:
```
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit
  -source               WhatsApp file containing the exported chat. It MUST be exported from Whatsapp Mobile App
  -resultset            Filename of the resultset. CSV extension should be included in the filename
  -channel              Slack channel name
  -datesep              Specifies the separator character that appears between the year, month, and day
  -formatdatetime       Full DateTime Format. Must define 'datesep' as well. Default: %m/%d/%y %H:%M  
```

### Usage

Example command to convert the sample:

```
python src/main.py -source samples/conversations.txt -channel SAMPLE
```


```
// Exmaple including datetime formating
python src/main.py -source samples/conversations.txt -channel SAMPLE -datesep=. -formatdatetime=%d.%m.%Y\ %H:%M
```

Both examples create a file named `OUTPUT-conversations.csv` in the 'samples' folder, which can be imported to Slack.
